    "\n",
    "If you’re trying to copy files around, the easiest way to do this is using the cp command. Use the following script to copy around files.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cp -r target destination\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this script, `cp` represents copying and `-r` represents doing it recursively. The target is the `target` folder/file you’re trying to copy, and `destination` is the target folder you’re trying to copy it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "- Let’s say you type in `cp -r home/target/ home/destination/`. If `home` is a folder and `target` is a folder, but `destination` is not a folder in home, then `target` will be copied into home but will be named `destination`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let’s say you type in `cp -r home/target/ home/destination/`. If all of these are valid folders, `target` will be copied as a folder inside of `destination` inside of `home`, i.e. you’ll end up with a folder that’s `home/destination/target/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let’s say you type in `cp -r home/target/ users/`. This will just copy the `target` folder into the `users` folder under the same name (target).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `*` character to represent all. For example, to copy all files in a folder that start with the letter a, your target should be `/folder/a*`. To copy all files of a certain extension (say something like .png), your target should be `/folder/*.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `.` character to represent the current folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the file/folder already exists in destination, it WILL BE OVERRIDDEN. So make sure you don’t make this rookie mistake!"

    "\n",
    "- Use the `*` character to represent all. For example, to delete all files in a folder that start with the letter a, your target should be `/folder/a*`. To delete all files of a certain extension (say something like .png), your target should be `/folder/*.png`.\n",
    "- Use the `.` character to represent the current folder.\n",
    "- This command will delete files VERY QUICKLY. When a file is deleted, you can’t get it back. There’s no \"control-z\" on this. Always make sure you type in the right `directory/file`.\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can enter `-i` after `-r` (e.g. `rm -r -i target`), which will prompt the computer to ask for permission to delete every single file."
