    "## Summary: Error Handling Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**EAFP** (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) uses `try/except` with the method of attempting the action and handle errors. **LBYL** (Look Before You Leap)checks conditions with `if` statements before attempting actions. **EAFP** is generally more Pythonic and handles edge cases you might not anticipate\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many Try/Except syntax patterns, and you can decide whether to handle or re-raise the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build robust functions using type casting + error handling, combine type hints (documentation) with type casting (enforcement), as well as `try`/`except` around casting operations to handle conversion failures, providing sensible defaults or raise clear errors when casting fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this in practice helps to create production-ready patterns:\n",
    "   - Be specific with exception types (catch `FileNotFoundError`, not just `Exception`)\n",
    "   - Provide helpful error messages that guide users on how to fix the issue\n",
    "   - Log errors before re-raising them for debugging\n",
    "   - Consider returning `None` or default values for non-critical failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember** that good error handling makes your code resilient, debuggable, and user-friendly."
